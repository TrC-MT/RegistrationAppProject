//I want to change from pageNumber to something more descriptive. I'm going to take some time to think about it first.

import page1 from './loginPage'
import page2 from './signUpPage'
import page3 from './profilePage'
import page4 from './studentCourses'
import page5 from './adminData'


export default {
    Page1: page1,
    Page2: page2,
    Page3: page3,
    Page4: page4,
    Page5: page5,
}
